Abrupt Numerical Graph Language

By Aries Powvalla
---------------------------------------------------------------

ANGLing Laws:
1. Every ANGL program operates on a 16x16 grid.
  a. From (1,1) at top left to (16,16) at bottom right.
2. Space values can span -128 to 128.
3. At the beginning of the program, the (1,1) tile is selected.
4. Commands can be used to manipulate the grid.

------------- Practical Usage Pros/Cons -------------

Pros:
Extremely low file size
Extremely minimal compiler
Moderately fast at industry standard

Cons:
Very complex syntax
Not expandable
Few use cases

----------------

PRACTICAL USE CASES:
Mathematical Computation/Evaluation
Physics Computation
Fluid Dynamics

POTENTIAL USAGES:
Non-classical Mathematics (Sub-Euclidian, Relativity Plot)
Root programming
ASCII Construction


------------- Program Init -------------

Fully initializing your program is not required. Not initializing your program will set the following values:

projectname: AngledScript
projectauthor: Unknown
projectversion: v0.1
process_clock: 23
error_skipping: 0
parse_timeout: 100
builtin_debugger: 0
alternate_complier: 0
max_cache: 6

In order to modify these options in your project, add the line as shown above to the beginning of the .angl file.

NOTE: ONLY LETTERS, NUMBERS, _, AND - CAN BE USED

After modifying settings as desired, a line should be left empty. The line following should contain a single start character, "!" (More below), and the code can begin.

------------- Init Functions -------------

PROCESS CLOCK -- Milliseconds per tick. ANGL attempts to run at 10 operations per tick, but upon failing will fallback to the next multiple of ticks. Setting to 0 is not recommended as it disables the space operation. 23 is an optimal value according to Veghowards lawset.

ERROR SKIPPING -- Whether errors stop the program and raise a callback or ignore the operation. 1 = SKIP, 0 = FLAG

PARSE TIMEOUT -- Milliseconds an operation is allowed to take to execute fully. Values above 120 are not recommended because if a function takes this long, something is probably broken.

BUILT-IN DEBUGGER -- Enables the builtin debugger that is wrapped with the engine itself. Enabing the debugger force-disables the visualizer (~)

ALTERNATE COMPILER -- Whether an alternate compiler is used. Can be useful on unstable platforms, or if main compiler causes a memory leak. 0 = MAIN COMPILER, 1 = ALTERNATE COMPILER, -1 = C.A.R. SELECTION (at bottom)

MAX CACHE -- Maximum amount of operations allowed to be cached at a certain point in time. Decrease to free up resources but slow down large programs. 6 is sufficient for most devices (4GB RAM) and programs (<2k OPERATIONS).

------------- Operations -------------

Important notes: Some operations can handle multiple inputs/outputs, and some have a separate function for such cases. When the guide refers to a "selected" space, that is where the selector is currently placed. When the guide refers to a "saved" space, that is the position(s) previously saved using the (@) operation.

File Operations

! : Script start/end (Comments can be added only after the final "!" character.)


Movers

* : Move selector to (1,1).
v : Move selector down one space.
^ : Move selector up one space.
> : Move selector right one space.
< : Move selector left one space.


Selection

@ : Save to selector (STM).
_ : Deselect/Unsave (STM).


Selector Modifiers

Q : Expand selector by one space both down and right.
q : Shrink selector by one space both up and left.
$ : Reset selector to 1x1.


Incrementors

+ : Adds one to the space(s) selected.
- : Subtracts one from the space(s) selected.
x : Resets space(s) selected to 0.
" : Doubles space(s) selected.
' : Halves space(s) selected.

a : Adds the saved spaces' value to the space(s) selected.
   > If saved and selected space amount match, they add correspondingly.
   > If amount of saved spaces are more than or less than amount of selected spaces, saved spaces are added together and the resulting value is added to each selected space.

s : Subtracts the saved spaces' value from the space(s) selected.
   > If saved and selected space amount match, they subtract correspondingly.
   > If amount of saved spaces are more than or less than amount of selected spaces, saved spaces are added together and the resulting value is subtracted from each selected space.

m : Multiplies the saved spaces' value and the spaces' value(s). Same rules apply.

d : Divides the saved spaces' value from the spaces' value(s). Same rules apply.

% : Performs the modulo of the selected space over the saved space. Same rules apply.

Self Incrementors

{ : Saves the value of all selected spaces' values added together.

} : Saves the value of all selected spaces' values subtracted, in order.

* : Saves the value of all selected spaces' values multiplied together.


Standard Outputters

p : Output raw data of spaces selected (Number/Array).
P : Output ASCII table conversion of SPACE (1) selected (ABSOLUTE VALUE).
m : Perform addition operation on selected SPACES (>1) and output number.
f : Perform subtraction operation on selected SPACES (>1) and output number (NEGATIVES ALLOWED).
M : Perform addition operation on selected SPACES (>1) and output ASCII.
F : Perform subtraction operation on selected SPACES (>1) and output ASCII (ABSOLUTE VALUE).


Other Ouputters/Savers

r : Output selected row.
c : Output selected column.
R : Save selected row.
C : Save selected column.


Functions

[_CODE_]# : Loop _CODE_ for # times.

d : Get numerical user input and insert as selected space(s) value.
D : Get 1 character user input, convert via ASCII, and insert as selected space(s) value.
u : Get numerical user input and save it.
U : Get 1 character user input, convert via ASCII, and save.

( : Move selector to the first instance of the saved number (Left-Right, Top-Bottom).
) : Move selector to the last instance of the saved number (Bottom-Top, Right-Left).

\ : Sets selected space to 1 if value of selected space is greater than value of saved space.
= : Sets current space to 1 if current space(s) matches saved value(s), otherwise set to 0. Same amount of tiles must be selected.


Miscellaneous

[space] : Halt for 10 ticks (200 ms by default).
[newline] : Deselect, Move to (1,1).
[double_newline] : Deselect, Move to (1,1), Reset all tiles to 0.
. : Lock space (Cannot be modified).
, : Unlock space (Can be modified).
# : Filler character
? : Move cursor in a random direction


C.A.R. SELECTION:
The frontend will run the first 120 operations of the program on both compilers and continue.
